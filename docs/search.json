    "text": "1. The Shuffle: The Thanksgiving Spike\nThe system breathes. It stresses, and it recovers. By analyzing daily flight volumes and their trailing 3-day averages, we can see the precise moment the system “crashes.”\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nFigure 1: Daily Flight Volume vs. Rolling Average (Nov 2017)\n\n\n\n\nInsight. Note the massive drop on Thanksgiving Day followed by an immediate increase on the 26th. Although the holiday season is always considered busy, the holiday itself is empty. It is reasonable to see this phenomenon because people are celebrating on the holidays, and go back to work after spending time with family in different places.\n\nWeekday Load: Picking Your Travel Day & Preparing For The Inevitibles\nThanksgiving week also exposes structural weekday differences. Wednesday shows the heaviest burden, while Saturday is comparatively quiet.\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nFigure 2: Flight Volume by Day of Week\n\n\n\n\nTakeaway: When travelling on Wednesday, airport can increase staff members on duty to maintain the flow in airport and prevent potential delays. Travellers should try book flights with careful considerations on buffer time to prepare for potential delays. Weekends stay lighter because most leisure travelers aim to return Sunday and business flyers stay home, so Saturday actually offers some breathing room. But this month’s data can potentially be affected by Thanksgiving compare to normal weekend patterns. Still, while Sunday, Nov 26th was the single busiest day, Wednesday captured the highest total volume for the month. This is driven by two factors:\n– Calendar Structure: November 2017 contained five Wednesdays compared to only four Sundays.\n– The ‘Getaway’: Wednesday, Nov 22nd (right before Thanksgiving) is a peak travel day, compounding the volume of the standard business-travel traffic seen on typical Wednesdays."

Hence it is the best option to consider when travelling with emergency\nTail risk: American (AA) and Spirit (NK) recorded extreme operational failures exceeding 24 hours.
